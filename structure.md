## Why this topic matters in relation to this module

It shows us the benefits of wireframing and provides steps on how to do it.

* Wireframing is designing and planning the information hierarchy of your site.

* You can use online tools to wireframe or just paper and pencil

* Wireframing also involves a lot of research of the target audience.

Being able to navigate your site easily increases user confidence in your brand. Wireframing lets you plan out how you want the users to flow through the site. Don't go in detail in your wireframe. Just form the skeleton of your design.
