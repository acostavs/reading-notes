## Cascading Style Sheets

CSS is a rule based programming language. It allows us to style our website and control layout. The syntax is `selector{property: value; property: value}`. These property : value pairs are called **declarations**. CSS properties have different allowable values, depending on the property being used.

The 3 ways to insert CSS are:

1. extrenal
2. internal
3. inline

## Extenal Method

Link the .css file in the head tag of the html file you're working on.

## Internal Method

Put a style tag in the head section of the html file you're working on.

## Inline Method

Add the style attribute in the element you want to style. Has highest priority.
