        The standards for JavaScript are the ECMAScript Language Specification (ECMA-262) and the ECMAScript Internationalization API specification (ECMA-402). Don't confuse JavaScript with Java. You can type JavaScript code directly inside the HTML file with a <strong>script</strong> tag or link an external js file. In most cases external is recommended. A simple to interact with the users is using the <code>alert()</code> function. The <code>document.write</code> function is used to change content on the page. To use it type <code>document.run("")</code>. You can print messages for yourself in the console using <code>console.log("")</code>. Another method you can use JS to interact with users the <code>prompt("how old are you?")</code> function. This brings up a pop-up with your message and a text bow for the user to write input. You can declare a variable and assign it the value of <code>prompt()</code>. Then use <code>document.write(variableName)</code> to write to the page the input the user provided. You can delare a variable with <code>let, const, and var</code>. Var is an old way of doing things and you shouldn't use it.
