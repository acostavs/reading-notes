## Selecting Your Text Editor

When choosing a text editor you can use what is already installed on your computer or third-party software.
Keep in mind that while 3rd party text editors come full of features, pre-installed editors come "bare bones".

> Itâ€™s important for software developers to be thoughtful about their choice of text editor because some don't come
with important features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and a good number of extensions available.

## The Command Line

The command line/terminal gives us a way to give commands to our system via a text based interface.

## Basic Navigation

The `cd` command lets us move around our file system.

* The `cd` is like clicking folders in the gui to explore files.

The `file` command, followed by file name, tells us what type of file we're working with
(i.e. .txt, .png, .js).

* It's like left clicking on a file in File Explorer and going to Properties in a gui.
